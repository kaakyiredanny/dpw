    Features of HTML Now that you have an idea about the introduction of HTML, letâ€™s know about some of its key features: <br><br>

1. <i class="uil uil-arrow"></i> Structure 
HTML provides a way to structure web pages using <strong>elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and more</strong>. This allows content to be organized and presented in a logical manner. <br><br>

2. <i class="uil uil-arrow"></i> Hyperlinks
HTML enables the creation of hyperlinks, also known as <strong>anchor tags</strong>, which allow users to navigate between different web pages by clicking on links.<br><br>

3. <i class="uil uil-arrow"></i> Images and Media
We can use HTML to include <strong>images, videos, and audio files</strong> in web pages using elements such. This enhances the visual and multimedia experience for users. <br><br>

4. <i class="uil uil-arrow"></i> Forms 
There are <strong>form elements in HTML</strong> that allow users to input data, such as submitting a contact form or making selections from dropdown menus.
<br><br>

5. <i class="uil uil-arrow"></i> Semantics
HTML includes <strong>semantic elements that give meaning and structure to different parts of a web page</strong>. This helps search engines understand the content and improves accessibility for users with assistive technologies. <br><br>

6. <i class="uil uil-arrow"></i> Cross-platform compatibility
All the major web browsers support HTML. <strong>It works across different operating systems</strong>, making it a reliable and universal language for creating web pages. <br><br>

7. <i class="uil uil-arrow"></i> Easy integration with CSS and JavaScript
HTML seamlessly integrates with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to add visual styles and layouts to web pages, as well as JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic behavior. <br><br>

8. <i class="uil uil-arrow"></i> Responsive design
HTML provides features and techniques, <strong>such as media queries and responsive frameworks</strong>, that allow web pages to adapt and display well on different screen sizes and devices. <br><br>

9. <i class="uil uil-arrow"></i> Accessibility
There are several accessibility features supported by HTML, <strong>like alt text for images, semantic markup for screen readers, and ARIA attributes</strong> to make web content accessible to users with disabilities. <br><br>

10. <i class="uil uil-arrow"></i> Continuous evolution
HTML is constantly evolving, with <strong>new versions and specifications</strong> being developed to introduce new features and improve the language's capabilities.

                            <strong>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</strong>, and it's used to add style to a web page by dictating how a site is displayed on a browser. <strong>CSS</strong> is unique in that it doesn't create any new elements, like HTML or JavaScript. Instead, it's a language used to style HTML elements.

            1. <i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> Selector
Selectors pinpoint the HTML components on web pages that need styling. The HTML elements that one should choose to have the CSS property values in the rule applied to them are specified by a pattern of terms and other elements called CSS selectors. Selectors include: <br><br>
<span>*</span> Simple selectors <strong>(for elements based on name, id, and class)</strong><br>
<span>*</span> Combinator selectors <strong>(for elements based on a specific relationship between them)</strong> <br>
<span>*</span> Pseudo-class selectors <strong>(for elements based on a particular state)</strong> <br>
<span>*</span> Pseudo-elements selectors <strong>(to style a part of an element)</strong> <br>
<span>*</span> Selectors for attributes <strong>(for elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</strong> <br><br>

2. <i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> Properties
<strong>The styles used on specific selectors are CSS properties</strong>. It functions similarly to attributes like background color, font size, position, etc. <strong>The CSS ruleset places them before values</strong>, and a colon separates them from property values. There are several attributes for various HTML selectors and elements.
Some properties can be applied to any selector and are universal. Others only operate in certain situations and on specific selectors. <strong>Grid-template-columns</strong>, which are used to style the page layout, are an example. It primarily functions with divs with the grid display property set (we shall look at the key properties of CSS later in the article). HTML selectors also have numerous characteristics and their corresponding values. <br><br>

3. <i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> Values
<strong>Values that are assigned to properties define those properties</strong>. In CSS, text values are common. In contrast to strings, <strong>they are typically written without quotations</strong>. In addition to text, CSS values can also take the shape of URLs, measures, numbers, etc. Specific CSS attributes permit integer definitions for their values, including negative numbers. <strong>One can express CSS values in various property-specific units, but standard units include px, em, fr, and percentages</strong>. CSS values can have several values and can be used to create shorthand by manipulating them. Properties like background images require an actual URL as their value.

The following are the features of interactive languages features such as JavaScript, Nodejs, PHP, Python, Java, Kotlin, C++, C# etc <br><br>
<p>
1. <i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> Light-Weight Scripting Language
<strong>JavaScript is a lightweight scripting language</strong> because it is made for data handling in the browser or the client side.
Because JavaScript is meant for client-side execution for web applications, hence the lightweight nature of JavaScript is a great feature. <br> <br>

2. <i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> Dynamic Typing
JavaScript supports dynamic typing which means types of the variable are defined based on the stored value.
For example, if you declare a variable x then you can store either a string or a Number type value in JavaScript or an array or an object. <strong>This is known as dynamic typing.</strong>
To understand this, in languages like Java, we explicitly mention that a particular variable will store a certain type of data, whereas in JavaScript we do not have to provide the data type while declaring a variable.
In JavaScript, we just have to use var or let keyword before the variable name to declare a variable without worrying about its type. For example, <br><br>

// below we have created a variable with string value
let str = "Studytonight" <br><br>

<i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> Object-Oriented Programming support
Starting from ES6, the concept of class and OOP is better defined.
<strong>Also, in JavaScript, two important principles with OOP in JavaScript are:</strong>
Object Creation Patterns (Encapsulation) Code Reuse patterns (Inheritance). Although JavaScript developers rarely use these features, it's there for everyone to explore. <br><br>

3. <i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> Functional Style
This implies that JavaScript uses a functional approach, even objects can be created using constructor functions and each constructor function represents a unique object type. <strong>Also, functions in JavaScript can be used as objects and can be passed to other functions too.</strong> Many important JavaScript concepts and features like callbacks, closures, etc. are implementations of functions only. <br><br>

4. <i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> Platform Independent. <strong>This implies that JavaScript is platform-independent or we can say it is portable.</strong>
This simply means that you can simply write the script once and run it anywhere and anytime.
In general, you can write your JavaScript applications and run them on any platform or any browser without affecting the output of the Script. <br><br>

5. <i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> Prototype-based Language. <strong>JavaScript is a prototype-based scripting Language. This means JavaScript uses prototypes instead of classes or inheritance.</strong> In languages like Java, we create a class and then we create objects for those classes. But in JavaScript, we define an object prototype, and then more objects can be created using this object prototype. <br><br>

6. <i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> Interpreted Language. JavaScript is an interpreted language which means the script written inside JavaScript is processed line by line. <strong>The JS code is interpreted by JavaScript interpreter which is a built-in component of the Web browser.</strong> But these days many JavaScript engines in browsers like the V8 engine in Chrome use just-in-time compilation for JavaScript code. <br><br>

7. <i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> Single threaded. <strong>JavaScript doesn't support multi-threading</strong>, by default it is single-threaded, which means it can execute only a single task at a time. But JavaScript provides some features using which you can implement parallel execution. They are: <br>

*Async processing <br>
*Web workers <br><br>

8. <i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> Async Processing
JavaScript supports <strong>Promise which enables asynchronous requests wherein a request is initiated and JavaScript doesn't have to wait for the response if a request takes time and may block the request processing.</strong>
Also starting from ES8, Async functions are also supported in JavaScript, these functions don't execute one by one, rather they are processed parallelly which has a positive effect on the processing time, reducing it to a great extent. <br><br>

9. <i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> Web Workers. Using Web workers you can run processes in background threads so that you can have parallel execution.
If you have any task that performs some heavy-duty work, then you can use a Web worker to run it in the background. <br><br>

10. <i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> <strong>Client-side Validations.</strong> This is a feature that has been available in JavaScript since the beginning and is still widely used because every website has a form in which users enter values, and to make sure that users enter the correct value, we must put proper validations in place, both on the client side and on the server-side.
<strong>JavaScript is used for implementing client-side validations</strong>. <br><br>

11. <i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> More control in Browser
<strong>JavaScript being a client-side language</strong> provides many features that help developers to divide processing between browser and server hence <strong>reducing the load on servers by having basic processing, validations, temporary data saving using cookies, etc.</strong> on the browser itself. Along with all these features, JavaScript provides the following useful features too: <br><br>

<span>*</span>Detecting browser type, name OS version, etc information of the client for analysis. <br>
<span>*</span>Extensive in-built library with many useful functions for validation, data type conversion, string operations, etc.
<span>*</span>It is an object-centered language with Window Object being the most important object in JavaScript and <span>*</span>it also supports Polymorphism.
<span>*</span>Support for commonly used complex data types like arrays, Maps, lists, etc. with support of in-built functions to operate on them. <br><br>

12. <i class="uil uil-brackets-curly"></i> Backend Development
<strong>With NodeJS, backend development can also be done using JavaScript.</strong> MERN stack is one of the most popular stacks based on JavaScript for Fullstack Development using JavaScript. ExpressJS can be used for API or REST service development. <strong>NodeJS brings in npm which is a package manager for JavaScript modules</strong>, hence you can use 3rd party packages too, making the backend development even more fun and easy in JavaScript.
